# Welcome to my cornerstone(ish) react project

This is a simple single page web app, designed with cooking, shopping and healthy eating in mind. This project utilises react for the front end interactivity and all of the information displayed has been pulled from spoonacular's API using axios, as it is my preferred method of calling endpoints.

# Using the application

It should be pretty self explanatory from the site but: you hit add meal; enter into the fields what food you want to search for, apply any constraints to the results that you want; hit add meal, and then information will be displayed to you relative to your meal choice.

# Further info

This project has been deployed through vercel and can be found at
